/**
 * VERIFIED venue photos — per-venue, licensed, attributed.
 *
 * HONESTY CONTRACT (read before editing):
 *   * An entry exists ONLY for a venue whose photo was retrieved from
 *     Wikimedia Commons via its authorised API WITH license metadata, whose
 *     license is in the allowlist (CC BY / CC BY-SA / CC0 / Public domain —
 *     never NC/ND), AND whose content was VISUALLY verified to depict THIS
 *     specific venue (one candidate was rejected exactly this way: a generic
 *     "Tirupati hills from train" photo surfaced for a temple query and is
 *     NOT included — see worklog B-asset pass).
 *   * `credit` / `license` / `sourcePage` are recorded EXACTLY as the source
 *     publishes them — never invented, never paraphrased. The detail hero
 *     renders the credit and links the source page (the license requires
 *     attribution; we also add a link to the license where available).
 *   * Venues WITHOUT an entry (all 86+9 food places and the 6 lodging
 *     hotels) intentionally render the honest category illustration
 *     instead — a photo is never borrowed across venues and never
 *     hotlinked from official pages (venue-copyright).
 *   * Assets ship from public/images/places/ (WebP, width ≤ 800px, quality
 *     78) so the browser caches them; no third-party image host is hotlinked
 *     at runtime.
